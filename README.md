### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer who's proficient in Javascript, Python, Ruby, React.js, Redux.js, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL! I also have prior experiences working at multiple tech companies in Business Operations, Sales Operations, and Commercial roles where I worked on revenue scaling projects, defining and building out metrics reporting, and wrote automation scripts in Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a chatbot that uses an AI library
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redis and Go
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on startups/early stage companies
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, Javascript, my Projects, or my Hobbies!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love surfing at OBSF, playing tennis, and developing my early jiu-jitsu skills
